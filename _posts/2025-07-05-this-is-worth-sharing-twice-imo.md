<p>
I linked to this free online book last year over at the hub and someone mentioning it again this morning on my Mastodon timeline prompted me to share it here as well:
</p>
<p>
<a title="HTML for People" href="https://htmlforpeople.com/">HTML for People</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This book is aimed at people who have no prior coding experience of any kind. I wonâ€™t assume you know the first thing about HTML. We will start small. But by the end of the book we will have built a personal website...
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
To those of you just getting started in making a website, I hope you find it helpful.
</p>
<p>
Cheers!
