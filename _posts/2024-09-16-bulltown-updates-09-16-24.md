<p>
You may have noticed the journal is now searchable, implemented a fews weeks back. More recently in addition to working on <a href="https://bulltown.neocities.org/">bulltown.neo</a>, I added a ’link to us’ section on the <a href="links/">links</a> page, which includes new button choices. As always, the <a href="links/">links</a> page button wall and the <a href="/webgarden/">webgarden</a> are both steadily growing.

<p>
In other words, I’ve been having an s*load of fun with <em>bulltown</em> lately!
