<p>
The big button walls on the links pages of 𝗯𝟮𝟮 and 𝗯.𝗻𝗲𝗼 are growing like crazy - there’s now over 1,200 linked buttons - yay!
</p>
<p>
When I started bulltown, I decided to leave it up to each visitor whether to show animations - it’s off by default. The script I use has been taking about 6 seconds to process all those buttons. Something’s in place I hope will improve that.
</p>
<p>
	Update 10/13/25, 7:33 PM: Big improvement at 𝗯𝟮𝟮 - tomorrow’s update at 𝗯.𝗻𝗲𝗼 will implement the same improvement.
