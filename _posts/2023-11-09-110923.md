A big <em>thank you</em> to <a title="credits | jasmine's journal" href="https://jasm1nii.xyz/credits/">jasmine</a> for leading me to <a title="Tutorial | Implementing Freezeframe JS - Bechno Kid's Hideout" href="https://bechnokid.neocities.org/resources/tut_freezeframe">a great tutorial</a>, which was helpful in my implementing <a title="GitHub - ctrl-freaks/freezeframe.js: freezeframe.js is a library that pauses animated .gifs and enables them to animate on mouse hover / mouse click / touch event, or with trigger / release functions." href="https://github.com/ctrl-freaks/freezeframe.js/">freezeframe.js</a> here at bulltown.

My old way of dealing with animated buttons was to disable animations for site visitors with computer preferences set to reduce motion. Now, with <em>freezeframe</em>, I’m able to give all visitors a choice regarding animations regardless of their preference settings. I like that better. Thanks to <em>ctrl-freaks</em> and project contributors as well!
