I’m glad to say I finished planned improvements and other changes to both <span style="color:#440303;font-weight:600;">bulltown<span style="color:#8b9675;">.2022</span></span> and <span style="color:#440303;font-weight:600;">bulltown<span style="color:#8b9675;">.neo</span></span> (for now anyway). 

You’ve probably already noticed this journal appears on the homepages of both sites. Another key change is both sites’ homepages share a common questbook.

Yes! I’m still having lotsa fun... 😎
