There's also something new after the <a href="/rings/">webrings</a>. If your system preferences are set to reduce motion, you won’t see it because some of the ‘ads’ in the iframe contain animations. Otherwise, you’ll see a <a href="https://dimden.dev/navlinkads/">NavLink Ad</a>, which changes every 30 seconds - something new I’m trying out.

Finally, if you’re interesting in reciprocal links, please let me know (via the <a href="https://joejenett.com/contact/">contact form</a>) and I’ll get back to you promptly. You’ll hear back from me within a day. And thanks!
