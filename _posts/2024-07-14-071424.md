Welcome to the new and improved bulltown! I just completed a major overhaul of the site. You’ll notice the URL has changed but not to worry - redirects are working if you’ve bookmarked or linked to bulltown or any journal posts at the old URLs.

We’re on a more webmention-friendly server now and updates are faster and easier to handle. Yay!

(Yes, Jack - it’s the big, positive change I alluded to.)
