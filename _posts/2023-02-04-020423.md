<p><img alt="" src="/images/colorbull.png" width="80" height="100" style="position:relative;float:right;margin:0 36px 8px 8px;">Though I’ve got to admit it’s fun playing around with AI, I can’t help but wonder where all the images used to train the software come from. Did some artist out there draw a bull that helped train the software though they never intended their art be used that way? Or maybe the artist’s work was licensed to be used only with attribution. </p>
<p>So it’s fun but I feel a little creepy about using the image here. I’ll at least give a little credit to the free app I used, <a href="https://drawthings.ai/"><em>Draw Things</em></a> (works on iPad Pro M1). Account sign-up and API key are not required to use the app.</p>
<p>The text of this post was written by a human being, thank you.</p>
<p style="font-size.8em;">* This is <em>bulltown</em> after all.</p>
