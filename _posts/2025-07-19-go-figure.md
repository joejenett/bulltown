Since I joined the Neocities community last September, I’ve said many times how much I love Neocities. I’ve been quite active in the community, interacting with sites I follow. 

I’ve made a lot of friends there - people I’ll always appreciate.

This morning, I was faced with the following message:
<blockquote>
<p>
To prevent spam, we have a 10 comment per day limit. Please try commenting again tomorrow! 
</p>
</blockquote>
That hurts, especially because I had only commented 3 or 4 times before seeing the message!

Perhaps I’ll visit the community again sometime next week... perhaps I won’t (but I will miss interacting with you guys and gals).
