Back in May I added an <a class="image" href="/images/show?image=mbjoe">old favorite</a> to <a href="/images/"><em>images</em></a>, which I wrote about yesterday over at <a href="https://iwebthings.joejenett.com/intelligent-colorization/"><em>i.webthings</em></a>. In a nutshell, the image was greatly improved, using a super cool <a href="https://palette.fm/">online tool</a> I found earlier in the week. That's why you see a ‘Palette’ button in the <a href="/#thanks">thanks section</a> on the main page.

<p>And speaking of the thanks section, please let know if you’re linking to bulltown so I can add your button too. Cheers!</p>
