	The dust has settled. Most of the changes are complete and should be easy to recognize. One change worth mentioning is the move to what I think is a better way to share my music. Btw - I’m grateful you’re here!

	The old music player was cool because it allowed continuous listening while browsing. But its script interfered with others and more importantly, it was forcing all external links to open in new windows or tabs. That bothered me - my visitors should be free to choose how they want to browse, imo. You can still listen continuously with the <a href="/music/">new player</a> and thanks to the change, you’ll notice that my little <a href="https://webneko.net/">Web Neko</a> is back up there in the corner. Yay!
