Remember that old adage, ”When life gives you lemons...?” Well, consider this post an attempt to make a little lemonade.
</p>
<p>
I do believe the people who run Neocities may have me confused with someone else:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
    Do not use the API to "game" the site (increase ranking by manipulating our algorithms, or constantly updating your index.html with the same content).
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Though I do sometimes update the bulltown.neo site as many as six times per day, my motivation is far different than that of the character that rule was written for. 
</p>
<p>
I’m just the old button wall guy trying to deliver what I’m known for. When someone follows me at the Neocities community, I make sure their button is promptly added to my ”neighbors” wall. Likewise, when I’m lucky enough to have someone link to my site, I make sure their button is promptly added to my ”mutuals” wall.
</p>
<p>
This ain’t rocket science ya know. I’m a simple web guy who’s been curating and sharing links on the web for a long, long time.
</p>
<p>
So, now that they decided to interrupt my interaction in the community for the second time in just a few weeks, I’m thinking the people who run Neocities must have me pegged as some sort of bad guy trying to get away with something.
</p>
<p>
Being the old button wall guy is just the most modern iteration of something I’ve been doing on the web for over 27 years. And I don’t take kindly to being treated like something else, thank you.
