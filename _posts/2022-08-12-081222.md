<p>I like something I bumped into at <a href="https://alexwlchan.net/
">alexwlchan</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you enjoy what I write, perhaps <a href="https://alexwlchan.net/say-thanks/">say thanks</a>?</p></blockquote>
<p>
On the linked page, they say, “I love it when people tell me they enjoyed something I made,” and, “If you’re inclined to make a monetary contribution, please consider donating what you would have sent me to a local food bank or homeless shelter.” 
</p>
<p>
I’d like to say the same to you and add that I appreciate your visit. Any feedback, thanks or otherwise, is always welcome. Oh, and thanks <a href="https://alexwlchan.net/">Alex</a>!
