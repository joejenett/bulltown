<p>I’ve gotta start by saying <em>thanks</em> to <a href="https://web.dev/">web.dev</a> for their <a href="https://web.dev/prefers-reduced-motion/">excellent article</a> on using the <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> media query - it was helpful in modifying the <a href="/links/">button wall</a> so that site visitors’ system preferences are considered when it comes to displaying animated buttons. It’s simple. If your system preferences are set to reduce motion, you’ll see static buttons - if you have no preference set regarding motion, you’ll see the animated buttons.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had recently tried a javascript approach to solving the same problem, which unfortunately, hosed the layout on mobile devices, so I abandoned it. I’m thankful to have found this simple CSS/HTML solution - it works and it’s mobile friendly. Yay!</p>
