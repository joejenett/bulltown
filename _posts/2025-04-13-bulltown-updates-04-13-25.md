There’s something I’ve been meaning to say about the bulltown button walls. Links are my life - I’ve been curating them forever. Though you won’t find a blogroll here, the <em>mutuals</em> and <em>followers</em> sections are full of sites I really like visiting - there’s some really cool creative people behind them.

I’m spread a bit thin among my various sites but I’ve got to tell you - the time I’ve spent hangin’ around the Neocities community has been the most fulfilling.
