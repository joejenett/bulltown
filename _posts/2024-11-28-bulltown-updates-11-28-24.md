First off, to my American friends, Happy Thanksgiving! üçó 

I‚Äôve been testing both versions of bulltown in Waterfox*, Firefox, Safari, and Vivaldi and tweaking the designs accordingly. So far, improvements have been made to the redesigned screensaver and the controls for the popup music player.

*<small> I use Waterfox when I‚Äôm prowling for new links because of it has certain bookmark management features that Firefox abandoned (boo!).</small>
