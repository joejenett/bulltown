In a recent blog post at bulltown.neo, I linked to a <em>page.i.like</em> on a site which, unknown to me at the time, also contained other toxic content aimed at the trans community.
</p>
<p>
I have to admit I should have done a better job of vetting the site. After it was brought to my attention in the Neocities community, I read some of the content in question. As a supporter of trans rights for decades, I was offended too! 
</p>
<p>
For what it’s worth, I fully understand the anger expressed. I’m sorry!
</p>

<p>
To my many friends and followers lost in the community:  I miss you guys and gals! I’m on your side and most important, I want you to know you're safe here. I do understand.
</p>
