I decided yesterday to limit updates to <em>bulltown.neo</em> to one per day as a way to demonstrate to the powers that be at the Neocities community that we’re all on the same side. My <a href="https://bulltown.joejenett.com/the-old-button-wall-guy/">previous post</a> should shed some light on what I’m talking about.
</p>
<p>
To be honest, doing frequent updates locally and consolidating them all into one daily site update is better. 
</p>
<p>
I probably should have been doing that all along for my own benefit. It’s more efficient.
</p>
<p>
I’ve learned everything I know the hard way folks.</p>
<p>
In the end, I’m kinda grateful the storm occurred.
</p>
<p>
Cheers!
