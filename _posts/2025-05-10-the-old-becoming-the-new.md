Ever since a certain orange character came down the fancy escalator to announce his intentions, I’ve consumed a fair amount of information daily by listening to news in the background. I need to know what’s up after all. 

For balance, it doesn’t hurt to also consume a comparable amount of music. Otherwise, I’d be a total nutbag.

In both cases, I’m motivated to feed my mind - you know what they say about it being ‘a terrible thing to waste.’ But if all I consume is _old media_, how do I find real balance in my life?

Enter the web. 

What happened in the early days of the web seemed magical to me. And now, several decades later, I’m feeling that same magic all over again.

People being creative for the sake of creativity, expressing their genuine selves. Community. Things like that.

It’s a great day, hopefully for you as well.
