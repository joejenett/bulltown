	In terms of blogs and homepages, the personal web appears to have recovered nicely from the damage done by corporate social media. Though Twitter (‘X’) and Facebook are still around, more and more people are opting to build a web presence of their own (just like they did before ‘Web 2.0’ and its corporate silos existed).

	Creativity for creativity's sake is alive and kicking. Kudos to personal expression!
