<p>I read something earlier this month that I definitely need to share here:<br><a title="Intro to the Web Revival #1: What is the Web Revival? | Melon's Thoughts" href="https://thoughts.melonking.net/guides/introduction-to-the-web-revival-1-what-is-the-web-revival">Intro to the Web Revival #1: What is the Web Revival?</a> - most <a href="https://iwebthings.joejenett.com/color-me-inspired-thank-you/" title="i.webthings">inspiring</a>!</p>  
<p><em>Web Revival</em> is the perfect name for what’s been happening recently on the personal web. Melon lists some of the ideals shared by enthusiasts of this revival and then goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>
These ideals are expressed by creating websites, homepages, zines, forums, podcasts and more! The goal is simply to find what was best about the early web, find whats best about new technology, mix the two; kick all the Mark Zuckerberg's and Elon Musk's to the curb and get on with living our best lives.

<p>Go explore the web y’all!</p>
