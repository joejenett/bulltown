Oops!

	I discovered just yesterday that 3 sections of the site (<em>words, other,</em> and <em>guests</em>) were affected by a perl script that had stopped working. It may have been like that for a few weeks or longer. Forunately, I found a redirect that was interfering with the script and resolved the issue last night. If you experienced issues recently, sorry. I was gonna fire the loose nut behind the wheel responsible for the problem but since that’s me, I didn’t. Cheers!
