Earlier this year I wrote <a href="https://simply.joejenett.com/notes-on-an-ageless-web/">something</a> over at the <em>simply.</em> blog which included what someone had said on the <em>bulltown</em> guestbook:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
holy shit you’re older than my dad
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I’m sure the 14-year-old who said it was right. When I was in my teens, I really thought that 30 must be the end of the road and I’m here to admit I was wrong (fortunately).
</p>
<p>
So. I’m now a proud member of <a title="Forever!" href="https://moonpr1sm.com/random/30plusclub">MOONPR1SM.com's 30+ Club!</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
...show the world you don't need to stop having fun just because you get older!
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I was a 4 or 5-year old snot-nosed kid when color TVs hit the mainstream and was already in my thirties when the internet was born. And here we are <em>in the now.</em>
</p>
<p>
Though I may have been <em>around the block</em> a few more times than most of you, I’m happy to say I’ve ended up exactly where I want to be... here with you. Thanks for stopping by.
