Just a quick note to let you know Iâ€™ve been working on improving how the button walls render on mobile. Though most of the work is being done offline, both <span style="color:#440303;font-weight:600;">bulltown<span style="color:#8b9675;">.2022</span></span> and <span style="color:#440303;font-weight:600;">bulltown<span style="color:#8b9675;">.neo</span></span>
may occasionally look a little funky as the project continues. Thx.

Update 10/02/24: Now that mobileâ€™s looking good, some other changes are underway - please stay tuned... ðŸ˜Ž
