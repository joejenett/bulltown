I’m thankful to report the [bulltown.sidecar webring](https://sidecar.neocities.org/) is starting to come alive. Six personal [websites](https://sidecar.neocities.org/member-list/) have joined up, each with plenty to explore. If your site is personal, please consider joining.

There’s two entryways to bulltown. While the dual versions look similar, each site has its own unique content aside from their _links_ pages, which are identical but maintained separately. Applying updates to two separate versions simultaneously has helped hone my skills a bit and I’m good with that.  

One’s never too old to grow.

Joining Neocities has been purely inspiring, thank you. Nuff said.
