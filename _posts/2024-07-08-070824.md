More people are making personal websites today than we’ve seen in a long time. There’s a retro vibe driving it. The web is fun again.

We still have social media. But now it’s decentralized and ad-free, not to mention, more friendly.

The best part is, all of the above lead to more meaningful encounters. For me, anyway.
