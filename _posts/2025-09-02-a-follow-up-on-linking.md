<p class="pt-9">
I said something <a href="https://bulltown.joejenett.com/bulltown-updates-02-16-25/">previously</a> that seems a useful place to begin:
</p>
<blockquote><p>There’s two entryways to <em>bulltown</em>. While the dual versions look similar, each site has its own unique content aside from their links pages, which are identical but maintained separately.</p></blockquote>
For clarity’s sake, I probably should have said, “aside from their button walls.” There’s also a button wall on each version’s main page which, like the button wall on each version’s links page, is identical to that of the other version.

Let me point out and clarify the differences and similarities between the main page button wall and the links page button wall (on either <em>bulltown</em> version). I like it when visitors understand this <em>bulltown</em> thing. Call me silly.

The top sections of the walls (‘mutuals &amp; affiliations’) on the main page and links page are identical.

On the main page, the two sections that follow, ‘neighborhood (neocities followers)’ and ‘also appreciated’ appear on the main page wall only. In some cases, a button may appear in more than one section of the main page button wall.

The links page wall contains buttons which appear in either the ‘mutuals &amp; affiliations’ section at the top or in the big wall below it, but not both. 

Buttons for sites that follow <em>bulltown</em> at Neocities (shown on the main page) are also included on the links page button wall.

In a nutshell, if you follow bulltown at Neocities and link to us as well, your linked button would appear a total of 3 times on both versions of <em>bulltown</em>. Color me grateful.

Cheers!
