<p><img src="/images/lily.png" width="140" alt="" style="position:relative;float:right;top:-24px;">I have to admit being somewhat intrigued by this beautifully <a href="https://alongtheray.com/driftwooding-into-the-sky-at-lake-whitney-texas">odd reflection</a> of the sky posted a few days ago.</p>
<p>And while I’m fessing up here, something Ray wrote back in <a href="https://alongtheray.com/i-felt-her">August</a> touched me a bit to the point of happy tears welling up in my eyes. Damn Ray - your creative outbursts are downright enjoyable! Do carry on please.</p>
