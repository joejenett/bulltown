<h2>
monday man: day 93</h2>
<p>Monday Man's been working full-time off the web and part-time on the web for a little too long now.&nbsp; He's sorta in a rut.&nbsp; Trying real hard to get the webthing going by doing it on a laptop on the train to and from work, and spending the few evening hours he has on it, he manages to put a pretty decent site out there.&nbsp; But each time he works on it, and the joy of creativity fills his being, he also feels the frustration of having next to no time to put into it.</p>
<p>Sure - the non-web thing pays the bills, and Monday Man remembers what it was like before when he worked full-time for himself.&nbsp; It was tough at times and the security that working for the big firm brings makes it hard to commit to a full-time change now.&nbsp; But this webthing has potential and Monday Man knows what he can do when he sets his java-driven mind on it.&nbsp; "More coffee - I need more coffee.", thinks Monday Man as he starts outlining his new business plan.&nbsp; "I know this thing has potential."</p>
