<h2>
monday man: day 50</h2>
<p>It's not easy being Monday Man.&nbsp; Living in a world of corporate poopoo, the weekend allows Monday Man to temporarily escape, but an awareness of what bugged him last week creeps into his consciousness as he heads to the office.&nbsp; Being resilient to yesterday's headaches is a key goal for Monday Man.</p>
<p>Nothing has really changed and thinking that it has is a major pitfall for him to avoid.&nbsp; Monday Man realizes that corporate poopooland is just what it is and trying not to be so surprised and reactive when the poopoo hits the fan is the decision to let resilience rule.&nbsp; It's not so bad being Monday Man - especially after the lobotomy.</p>
