<h2>
this ground is familiar
</h2>
<p>It seems I've been here before maybe it was yesterday<br>
ground swelling with anticipation of a day away from work<br>
a decision to vacate my spurious position<br>
becomes a reason to gloat if only for twenty four hours<br>
taking a sip of freedom laying on the ground<br>
taking in the light becomes today's toil<br>
checking out new jobs and the same old and what it might become<br>
that is today's fun tired of the boredom following mediocrity<br>
crying for a new beginning and pretending I'm free<br>
turning giants into figurines</p>
