</div><h2>When?</h2>
<p style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:500;">There’s something going on inside that I’ve been trying to capture.  It’s there.  I feel it, but letting it out has been most difficult.  If I could just say it, then I could realize clarity.</p>
<p>It starts with a dream I’ve had over and over.  It’s amazing how much coding I do in my sleep.  I see the content and read it, clear as day, and walk through the coding and always finish it.  And the first thing I think when I wake up is that I’ve got to upload it and then – damn! – I realize I still haven’t figured out how to save it...</p>
<p style="font-size:1.4em;font-weight:500;">And, so, I wait.  You wait.  We wonder.</p>
<p style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:500;">The question of motivation is not that hard to answer.  I need to be heard.  We all do.</p>
<p>When I was 6, I did a gig at the local movie house.  Lipsynching the words to "Blue Suede Shoes" with air guitar and all brought the house down.  I was hooked.  I liked being heard.</p>
<p>My mother’s attempts to get me to learn to play an instrument was always tied to some financial dream she had in her head about it.  If I could grow up to be rich, she would finally find that security she was so bent on achieving.  I loved music, but to take my stand and do what I wanted, I would resist those attempts.  Somehow, the thought of lessons and structure collided with my own prejudiced thoughts about what music meant to me.</p>
<p>After enough years of that, she decided I should be a doctor.  What a surprise!  The question of motivation is not that hard to answer.  At 21, I decided to learn to play the guitar.  I like to be heard – connected, if you will.  Learning to play the guitar never ended up making me rich, but it did make me whole.</p>
<p style="font-size:1.4em;font-weight:500;">What next?  We wait.  I wonder.</p>
