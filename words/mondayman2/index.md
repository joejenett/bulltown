<h2>
monday man: day 8</h2>
<p>I am a completely different Monday Man at the beginning of this week.&nbsp; I am calm, collected and rested.&nbsp; I even get up early so I won't have to rush to get ready for another great week at work - yeah, right.&nbsp; Swore off the beer and smokes, and went to sleep at a reasonable time each night this last weekend, for I am Monday Man - rested, bored and ready to reach new peaks of mediocrity.</p>
