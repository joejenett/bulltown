<h2>
thoughts grown in fear
</h2>
<p>whispered words another day<br>
passed unnoticed wasted tears<br>
something more than what we say<br>
is nothing less than what we fear<br>
growing tired in the turmoil<br>
some things never change<br>
you are me and I am empty<br>
I am you and you are strange<br>
vicious cycles we call life<br>
taking time in bits and bytes<br>
five days go and two days come<br>
catch our breath and feel the sun<br>
tell God I'm free... </p>
