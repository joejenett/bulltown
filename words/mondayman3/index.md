<h2>
monday man: day 22</h2>
<p>Monday Man woke up this morning and said (soundin' like James Brown himself) "I feel good."&nbsp; What's getting into him?&nbsp; Strain coming out of his ears and nothing's really changed, but Monday Man is mellow and humming.&nbsp; Whoa.&nbsp; Even Monday's can be great if your mind's in the right place.&nbsp; I am inspired.</p>
