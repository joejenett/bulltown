<h2>times goes in fragments</h2>
<p>a moment in time can last longer than time that's passed<br>
years can seem like hours as age devours<br>
 
thinking of nothing exact ignoring how I act<br>
until I hit an entrance to the things I've scattered around you<br>
 
another day I feel the rage connected with another's age<br>
visions of something bigger than time visions in another's mind<br>
 
if I forgot myself and let you down remember me to time<br>
all the fragments are yours, not mine<br>
trust grows into friendship</p>
