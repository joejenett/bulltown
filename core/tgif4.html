<h2>
the guacamole is fabulous</h2>
<p>the lights are dim and everyone is here<br>
the mayor, his wife, and his mistress<br>
all here separately among the throngs of celebrities<br>
Larry shows up with his mags and hands them out to everyone<br>
as the band plays on in a drone of bad tunes<br>
"how have you been?"<br>
it has been so long<br>
"great!"<br>
nice seeing you and goodbye again<br>
dancing now all over the room<br>
all the unknowns vie for attention<br>
celebrities plugging away as the mayor sneaks out with his wife<br>
leaving me here bored to death<br>
at least the guacamole is fabulous</p>
