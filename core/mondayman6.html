<h2>
monday man: day 92</h2>
<p>This webthing is in Monday Man's blood.&nbsp; Here he goes again, Monday morning, off to work (off the web) for the big firm downtown.&nbsp; Catching the early train, Monday Man plays with his webthing for 35 minutes, as he does on the way home, but all the time in between is spent working for someone else, doing less exciting things, and Monday Man is getting restless.&nbsp; "Change is good", he thinks, "Maybe it's time to play with my webthing full-time and make a living doing it."</p>
<p>The courage found in that first cup of java wears off, and Monday Man is now thinking about all those bills he has to pay and how much everything costs and how secure he feels and suddenly screams "I can do both for I am Monday Man."</p>
