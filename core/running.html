<h2>running</h2>
<p>"You'll see...things will be better
in Florida."</p>
<p>Packing us all into the old Ford
and hitting the road was the plan of the day.&nbsp; Running was always
the way of dealing with things and this was a run for the gold.</p>
<p>"I'm gonna miss him.&nbsp; He took
care of us and now we're on our own.&nbsp; But don't worry, I'll find another
man who will love us."</p>
<p>She couldn't understand the concept
of being worth something.&nbsp; Men and women, in her mind anyway, each
had their roles to play.&nbsp; The men took care of the women, and in return
the women did whatever they had to do.&nbsp; She would start a business
in Florida which would feed us all until she found the new Mr. Right.&nbsp;
It all meant nothing but a temporary belief in herself.&nbsp; She could
start a business but if she had to do it on her own, it would have to be
temporary.&nbsp; How could it be otherwise?</p>
<p>"Can we stop?&nbsp; I have to go
to the bathroom."</p>
<p>"Soon, dear, soon."</p>
<p>The long road flies by us as rain
hits the hood of the old Ford.&nbsp; What could we do but go along with
this plan?&nbsp; One day we'll grow up and do our own running.&nbsp; One
day we'll grow up and regress just like she has.</p>
<p>"Why do people die Mom?"</p>
<p>"They just do honey, they just do."</p>
<p>We finally stop and for a moment,
I think of running away.&nbsp; They won't miss me - I'm not worth anything
to them anyway.&nbsp; It's a circular thing.&nbsp; I go to the bathroom
and return to the car knowing that I have nowhere else to go.&nbsp; An
eleven year old goes where he's taken.</p>
<p>"You'll see, kids, it'll all work
out in Florida."</p>
