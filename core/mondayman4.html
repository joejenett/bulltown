<h2>
monday man: day 29</h2>
<p>I am tired and would like to stay home. &nbsp;But I can't, for Monday Man has much to do and must deliver. &nbsp;When you work for a big firm undergoing major transitions, you need every minute just to figure out how friggin' confused you have become. &nbsp;And it takes alot of work to "harmonize" your confusion with all the other people that work there.</p>
