<h2>new day</h2>
<p>
thought your time was planned for you<br>
you never stopped, you'd never do<br>
the crazy thing, you'd never sing<br>
a song about yourself
</p>

<p>
mountain roads and rainbows wide<br>
take a trip and step inside<br>
the one you know, it's time to go<br>
be strong about yourself
</p>

<p>
i've spent so many years<br>
thinkin' i was wrong<br>
i've cried too many tears<br>
singin' lonely blues songs
</p>

<p>
you're the one to help yourself<br>
as others fade away<br>
into night, you're gaining sight<br>
living out your new day
</p>
