<h2>
to give in freely
</h2>
<p>does she know I love her?<br>
as the work week drains us<br>
and we run to make it<br>
she inhabits my soul<br>
and I try to understand what she needs<br>
she tells me<br>
I don't hear it<br>
she tells me again<br> 
I have to respond<br> 
she tells me<br>
I realize I have to give in freely<br>
she tells me<br>
I realize it's true<br>
the girl is fire<br> </p>
