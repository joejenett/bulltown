<h2>
the green inner flow</h2>
<p>I try to relax inside the big granite box<br>
spending my days wanting to be somewhere else<br>
closer to the ground and the green inner flow<br>
with air to breathe and room to grow<br>
although no one notices or cares to admit<br>
the granite box is always sick<br>
collective psyche cries in pain<br>
box of stories box of rain<br>
I try to relax as days go by<br>
before the walls expose the sky<br> 
a glimpse of light begins to show<br>
I walk the ground and feel the green inner flow<br> 
it's finally time to go<br> 
tell God I'm frozen... </p>
