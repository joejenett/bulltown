<h2>
	to guard its fortresses</h2>
<p>I never understood war<br>
what do we want that's so dear<br>
that we will risk our people<br>
to hold it near?<br>
we build monuments to the power<br>
we think we hold<br>
and faraway neighbors beware<br>
because you've been told<br>
hide your babies<br>
hide your hearts<br>
hide your reason<br>
and let the war start!<br>
to give its families...<br>
for nothing</p>
